# Face-Recognition
## Capstone Design Project - Face Recognition System using OpenCV 3.1 C++ and Dlib

This program is a fully end-to-end video face recognition system. Given a set of user face images, the system is trained to recognize the
faces of the individuals in the given photos. The system detects the faces in the videos, crops them using Facial Landmark Detection, 
preprocesses them, and then applies a face recognition algorithm to identify the person in the frame. The system is able to run at a 
real-time speed.

This program was writting in C++ 11, using OpenCV 3.1 C++ API and Dlib.
